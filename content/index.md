title: Welcome to the Algo Handbook
---
This digital handbook is the ultimate 80/20 guide on how to navigate technical interviews. This brain-child of mine was born out of the frustration I faced when getting ready for the hiring season. Having forgotten the solutions to all those LeetCode problems I meticulously crafted solutions for, I loathed the decision paralysis that swept over me when facing the overwhelming amount of content, paid-courses and mediocre YouTube tutorials voiced-over with a 2011 Dell Laptop's microphone. Finding quality material in this miasma proves to be a real challenge but finding a content-creator/tutor that fits your learning style is a near-impossible feat. In this handbook I aim to cover what I believe to be the bare minimum concepts needed to pass technical interviews. Will you learn something here? Probably. Will this help you land an offer at FAANG? Not sure. But I invite you to join me on this journey in navigating the cesspool of technical interviews.
